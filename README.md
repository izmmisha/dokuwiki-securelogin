Securelogin Dokuwiki Plugin
==============

By Mikhail I. Izmestev.

This plugin lets you login securely without HTTPS. It uses [Tom Wu's implementation of RSA algorithm in JavaScript](http://www-cs-students.stanford.edu/~tjw/jsbn/) on the client to encrypt the password with the servers public key. The passwords are sent encrypted over HTTP. No need for HTTPS. Man-in-the-middle attacks are prevented by using a variable token (salt) added to the password before encrypting. Therefore, replay attacks don't work.

With version 20091213 and + , whenever a password has to be entered, it is automagically encrypted by this plugin, be it on the
*login*, *profile* or *admin* page.

securelogin version 20091206 and + is compatible with the showlogin plugin.

When securelogin is used, there is always a *use securelogin* checkbox near the password field. If the browser has no JavaScript or JavaScript is disabled, then obviously, the passwords are sent in clear text, as they are by default with DokuWiki. In this case though, the user will notice the absence of the checkbox.

Works with:

  * 2012-10-13 Adora Belle
